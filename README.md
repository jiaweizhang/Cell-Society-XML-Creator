# Cell-Society-XML-Creator
XML Creator for Cell Society. Created super quickly for your convenience.

##How it works
1. Select number of rows and columns
2. For each "characteristic" of a grid square, a random int or double is generated between the range, inclusive
3. Click "Create XML" to create the XML
4. Put it through an online free XML formatter if you want to prettify it. 
 
##Notes
1. The XML is well-formed
2. Don't leave any fields blank or something might break.
3. Don't blame me is something doesn't work.
4. This is designed for testing. Not for designing.
